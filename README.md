# BlueBuild Template

This is a constantly updating template repository for creating [a native container image](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/OstreeNativeContainerStable) designed to be customized however you want. GitHub will build your image for you, and then host it for you on [ghcr.io](https://github.com/features/packages). You then just tell your computer to boot off of that image. GitHub keeps 90 days worth image backups for you, thanks Microsoft!

For more info, check out the [BlueBuild homepage](https://blue-build.org/) and the [BlueBuild CLI](https://github.com/blue-build/cli)

## Getting started

See the [BlueBuild docs](https://blue-build.org/learn/getting-started) for quick setup instructions for setting up your own repository based on this template.

Don't worry, it only requires some basic knowledge about using the terminal and git.

After setup, it is recommended you update this README to describe your custom image.

## Customization

The easiest way to start customizing is by looking at and modifying `config/recipe.yml`. It's documented using comments and should be pretty easy to understand.

If you want to add custom configuration files, you can just add them in the `/usr/etc/` directory, which is the official OSTree "configuration template" directory and will be applied to `/etc/` on boot. `config/files/usr` is copied into your image's `/usr` by default. If you need to add other directories in the root of your image, that can be done using the `files` module. Writing to `/var/` in the image builds of OSTree-based distros isn't supported and will not work, as that is a local user-managed directory!

For more information about customization, see [the README in the config directory](config/README.md)

## Installation

> **Warning**
> [This is an experimental feature](https://www.fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/OstreeNativeContainerStable) and should not be used in production, try it in a VM for a while!

To rebase an existing Silverblue/Kinoite installation to the latest build:

- First rebase to the unsigned image, to get the proper signing keys and policies installed:
  ```
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/blue-build/template:latest
  ```
- Reboot to complete the rebase:
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```
- Then rebase to the signed image, like so:
  ```
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/blue-build/template:latest
  ```
- Reboot again to complete the installation
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```

This repository builds date tags as well, so if you want to rebase to a particular day's build:

```
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/blue-build/template:20230403
```

This repository by default also supports signing.

The `latest` tag will automatically point to the latest build. That build will still always use the Fedora version specified in `recipe.yml`, so you won't get accidentally updated to the next major version.

## ISO

This template includes a simple Github Action to build and release an ISO of your image. 

To run the action, simply edit the `boot_menu.yml` by changing all the references to startingpoint to your repository. This should trigger the action automatically.

The Action uses [isogenerator](https://github.com/ublue-os/isogenerator) and works in a similar manner to the official Universal Blue ISO. If you have any issues, you should first check [the documentation page on installation](https://universal-blue.org/installation/). The ISO is a netinstaller and should always pull the latest version of your image.

Note that this release-iso action is not a replacement for a full-blown release automation like [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please).

## `just`

The [`just`](https://just.systems/) command runner is included in all `ublue-os/main`-derived images.

You need to have a `~/.justfile` with the following contents and `just` aliased to `just --unstable` (default in posix-compatible shells on ublue) to get started with just locally.
```
!include /usr/share/ublue-os/just/main.just
!include /usr/share/ublue-os/just/nvidia.just
!include /usr/share/ublue-os/just/custom.just
```
Then type `just` to list the just recipes available.

The file `/usr/share/ublue-os/just/custom.just` is intended for the custom just commands (recipes) you wish to include in your image. By default, it includes the justfiles from [`ublue-os/bling`](https://github.com/ublue-os/bling), if you wish to disable that, you need to just remove the line that includes bling.just.

See [the just-page in the Universal Blue documentation](https://universal-blue.org/guide/just/) for more information.
